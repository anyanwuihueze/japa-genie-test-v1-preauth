*   **Minimum Funds Requirement Analysis:** The estimated minimum funds required for a Canadian student visa for a single applicant are significantly lower than the available funds. Specific requirements should be verified against the official IRCC website (https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship.html).  This analysis assumes a conservative estimate of the required funds based on publicly available information.
*   **Account Seasoning Compliance:** The account seasoning for both accounts exceeds the common requirement of 90 days, strengthening the credibility of the funds.
