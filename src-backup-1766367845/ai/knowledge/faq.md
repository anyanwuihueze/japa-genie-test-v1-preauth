# Frequently Asked Questions

This document contains answers to common questions about Japa Genie.

## General Questions

### Where do I sign up?
You can get started by clicking the "Get Started" or "Start Your Journey" button on our website, which will take you to our AI chat assistant. For full features, you can create an account using the "Log In" button and signing in with Google.

### Can I apply for multiple visa applications at once?
Japa Genie is designed to help you focus on one primary visa application at a time to ensure the highest quality and chance of success. While you can explore different options, we recommend completing one application before starting another.

### How do I save and continue my application later?
Your conversations with the AI assistant and your progress on your dashboard are automatically saved when you are logged into your account. You can sign out and sign back in at any time to continue where you left off.

### Can I edit my application after submitting it?
No. Once a visa application is submitted to an embassy or consulate, it cannot be edited. Our service helps you prepare and review your application thoroughly *before* you submit it to avoid this.

### What do I do if there’s a mistake in my form?
If you find a mistake before submitting your application, you should correct it immediately. Our AI Document Checker is designed to help you catch common errors. If you've already submitted, you will likely need to contact the embassy to withdraw and resubmit, which can cause delays.

### What payment methods are accepted?
We accept international credit and debit cards through **Stripe**. For users in Nigeria, we also support payments via card, bank transfer, USSD, and mobile money through **Paystack**.

### Will I receive an invoice?
Yes, after a successful payment, you will receive an email confirmation that serves as your receipt. Your payment history will also be available in your account.

### Is the payment portal secured?
Absolutely. We use industry-leading payment processors, Stripe and Paystack, both of which are PCI-compliant and use the highest level of security for all transactions. Your payment information is never stored on our servers.

### Are visa fees refundable?
The fees paid to Japa Genie for our services have a specific refund policy outlined in our Terms & Conditions. However, **application fees paid directly to embassies or governments are non-refundable**, regardless of the outcome of your application.

### How can I contact customer care?
You can reach our support team by emailing **support@japagenie.com**. For partnerships or media inquiries, you can use the respective email addresses on our Contact Us page.

### Can you check the status of my application?
Japa Genie helps you prepare your application, but we cannot check the status with the embassy on your behalf. We provide guidance on how to use the official government portals to track your application status yourself.

### How will I be notified of any updates or decisions?
All official updates and decisions regarding your visa application will come directly from the embassy or consulate to which you applied, usually via email or their online portal.

### Is my personal data secure?
Yes. We take data security very seriously. As outlined in our Privacy Policy, we use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information. Your data is not shared without your consent, and you can request its deletion.

### My uploaded files keep getting rejected. Why?
File rejection can happen for several reasons: the file size may be too large, the format may be incorrect (we recommend PDF, PNG, or JPG), or the document may be blurry. Please ensure your scans are clear and the file is a supported type. Our Document Checker can help analyze your files for quality issues.

### The website or app isn’t loading properly.
Please try clearing your browser cache and refreshing the page. If the issue persists, check your internet connection. Sometimes, browser extensions can interfere with site functionality, so try disabling them. If you continue to have problems, please contact our support team.

### Can I apply for a group or family visa?
Yes, our tools can help you prepare applications for family members. When using our Proof of Funds calculator, you can specify the number of family members to get accurate financial requirements. For complex family applications, we recommend connecting with one of our verified experts.

### How can I reapply if my previous visa was denied?
Our **Rejection Reversal** feature is designed specifically for this. It uses AI to analyze your rejection reason and personal background to create a new, stronger application strategy.

### What should I do if my passport is expiring soon?
Most countries require your passport to be valid for at least six months *beyond* your intended stay. If your passport is expiring sooner than that, you **must** renew it before submitting your visa application to avoid an automatic rejection.

### Can I apply on behalf of someone else?
While you can use our tools to prepare documents and information for someone else, the final application submitted to the embassy must be done by the applicant themselves or a legally authorized representative. Lying on a visa application can have serious consequences.

### Can I extend my visa using this software?
No. Japa Genie is a tool for preparing new visa applications. Visa extensions are handled by the immigration authorities of the country you are already in, and you must follow their specific renewal process.

### What’s the best pricing plan?
It depends on your needs!
- **One-Time Access (e.g., 1-4 Weeks):** Best if you have a specific, short-term goal like submitting an application soon.
- **Pro Plan (Monthly):** Ideal for ongoing support and peace of mind throughout your application journey.
- **Premium Plan (Monthly):** Perfect for those who want the added security of having a dedicated human expert to assist them.

### What if my payment fails?
If your payment fails, please double-check your card details, ensure you have sufficient funds, and that your card is enabled for international transactions. If the problem persists, try the alternative payment gateway (e.g., switch from Stripe to Paystack) or contact your bank.
